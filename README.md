# Unhandled Exception in Node.js Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js applications: unhandled exceptions that cause the server to crash.  The `server.js` file shows a server that throws an error without proper handling, resulting in a crash. The `serverSolution.js` file provides a solution using error handling to prevent crashes.

## Running the Code

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run `node server.js` to see the unhandled exception.
4. Run `node serverSolution.js` to see the improved, exception-handled version.
